It is 4:45PM. This is my first diary entry for my own personal project. These entries will be kept short unless I have something amazing to write about. Otherwise, don't expect much. 

Today I learned a lot about Git and GitHub. I also learned how to use GitHub with my projects so that I can store them and share them. I can tell that I have A LOT to learn. Yet, I am very excited for it all! 

On a side note, I am working on piano lessons and am making WONDERFUL progress! My fear of switching from the C position to the F position is slowly dissipating and I am very happy about that! I hope that by the time Alex comes back from his vacation, I will be able to play Joy to the World fairly well! 

I took Buster to meet one of Miriam's cats! He didn't destroy the cat. In fact, he wasn't aggressive at all! Rather, he was extremely curious and overly friendly! I was SO relieved! 

Finally, I miss Thomas. I cannot wait to see him ten days from now. :)
