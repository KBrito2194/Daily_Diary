<p>I have been working on this assignment. I was asked to recreate the google homepage. They told me not to be a perfectionist. I <strong>wasn't!</strong> <strong>Relax!</strong>
<br><br>
But! I did focus a lot on detail so that I can learn a lot from this activity! I feel like I learned so so so so much! I'm very happy that assignment is complete! 
<br><br>
Here is a list of what I did:
<ul>
    <li>Created buttons</li>
    <li>Created a search bar that I could not edit for the life of me.</li>
    <li>Created navigation bars!!! They are SO AMAZING!</li>
    <li>I did some other stuff I cannot remember at the moment...</li>
</ul>
<br>
It is 5:41PM. I'm going to walk Buster, watch a movie with Eli, and see Thomas 7 days from now. I am very content!</p>
<h3 class="thanks">Thanks for reading!</h2>
