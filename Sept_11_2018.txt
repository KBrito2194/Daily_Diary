It is 2:41PM. I had a LONG CS class with the Odin Project today. It was mainly long because I kept taking down a ton of notes. I really hope it was not for nothing.

I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am really confused about some of the things for each of them. However, I think that is normal. 

I am going to see a movie without Eli today. I feel kind of bad for it but I cannot keep waiting. I really want to watch searching and would like to get out of the house. I should not feel bad for it and I know that later on in the day/week I won't feel bad about it at all! 

I walked Buster earlier this morning and it POURED on me. Ironically, it stopped raining when I got home. I wasn't too upset. In fact, the rain on my face was kind of nice. I forgot what that felt like. I had a wind breaker on so my torso was completely dry. Buster was SOAKED. It was kind of funny and cute. 

After coding, I will do some piano! I need to teach myself how to play Joy to the World!! I will keep you posted on that! 

Finally, I think I am going to get 92 prayer. That is SOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE. The university needs to help me with that because it is extremely useful, but... man... 99 is 200 mil!!!

Thanks! This felt kind of good. <3
