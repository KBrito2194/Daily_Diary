<p>Today was exhausting. I no longer have the energy to complain about it. Here's what I learned: How to use HTML and CSS together by linking them up. It was tough but I think I got it down. I look forward to being able to style up my diary as well as make it possible that people can update their days and we can share the good and bad things that happen to our lives. That's all for today. Sorry. </p>
<h3 class="thanks">Thanks for reading!</h2>
