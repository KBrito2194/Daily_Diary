<h1 class="title">Coding is Exhausting</h1>

<p>Wow. Seriously. <strong>WOW.</strong>
<br><br>
I am so pooped. Today's coding started around 10AM and I am <em>just</em> finishing up at... <strong>5:12PM</strong>
<br><br>
I know my page looks ugly, but I just wanted to show off that I have been learning how to use html and css. There was this huge issue with not being able to get my html to link to my css so I ended deleting some files and starting over from scratch. I think I got it to work. I honestly don't even know anymore. I haven't practiced piano nor math and I don't know if I will. Thank god I have a ricecooker and am making food. I'll see what happens afer that. On the brightside, despite how exhausted I am.. I can honestly say this was fun and that I really look forward to making amazing things and sharing my diary one day. I also look forward to being able to make it so that others can update me on their days too! One day!

<h3 class="thanks">Thanks for reading!</h2>
